# Projects Me Practice

A simple coding practice repository containing various coding problems, without their solutions. The goal is to provide a platform for developers to practice coding problems on their own. This repository is intended to be installed on a private personal server, and this sends a weekly email with a new problem statement. Ideally I will be installing this on my raspberry pi and keeping that running 24/7 to send me weekly problems to solve.

# Note :

- The projects are not made by a very experienced person so please forgive any mistakes or bad practices.
- The problems are directly sourced from syntetic data created by AI, without letting it browse Internet in realtime. 
- The problems may not be very unique or original, as they are generated by AI.
- Report problems or suggest improvements via Issues section.
